WILDFIRE-WEATHER DATA ANALYSIS SUMMARY
==================================================

1. Dataset Overview:
   - Total records: 1445
   - Total features: 97
   - Key numeric features: 2

2. Missing Data Summary:
   - Columns with missing values: 90
   - Top 5 columns with most missing values:
     1. STANDARD_SNOW: 100.00%
     2. MINIMUM_AIR_TEMPERATURE: 100.00%
     3. ACTUAL_WIND_DIRECTION: 100.00%
     4. ACTUAL_WIND_SPEED: 100.00%
     5. PRECIP_TOTAL: 100.00%

3. Recommendations for Machine Learning:
   - Consider using the iterative imputation dataset for best results with missing values
   - Alternative approach: Use only columns with high data coverage
   - Target variable (FIRE_SIZE_HA) is highly skewed - consider log transformation
   - Key predictive features based on correlation:
     1. Elevation (m): 0.030

4. Feature Engineering Ideas:
   - Create temperature differential features (day/night, max/min)
   - Calculate drought indices from precipitation data
   - Combine wind speed and direction into vector components
   - Extract features like 'days since last precipitation'
   - Consider adding external data sources (vegetation indices, fuel moisture)
